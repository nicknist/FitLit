# FitLit

## Project Overview:

FitLit is all about your Journey to Health. By using FitLit, you get up to the minute info about various aspects of your daily health, including water intake, steps taken, sleep information, and more! You can also compare your activity to your friends to compete for Healthy Bragging Rights!

FitLit was designed to really dive into Test Driven Development. This project required setting up several Classes, each requiring multiple methods. Each Class JavaScript file was accompanied with a test JavaScript file. This project also focused on object oriented programing, making multiple Classes "talk" to one another, and using the Class methods to manipulate the DOM and make the entire app dynamic. 

## Wins

This project was all about diving into front-end testing. We were able to test all of our functionality with Mocha and Chai, which was one of the big learning goals. In addition, we worked with data sets and mocking up data in order to correctly test what we were trying to run. 

## Note about setup:
